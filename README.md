Our stakeholder will be the City of Chicago Department of Transportation (CDOT). The purpose of this project is to provide the CDOT with valuable insight regarding the factors that most contribute to an increasing severity of crashes (fatalities, serious injury), as well as a predictive model that can be used to make recommendations to the city in order to help reduce injuries and create safer roads and driving conditions.


BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Chicago Department of Transportation would like to find ways to decrease fatal car accidents.
Using the data from Chicago Data Portal, we would like to determine the key features that predict a fatal car crash and make appropriate recommendations.
